The scripts here are to ease building DTrace on an Ubuntu installation.

To work properly, the top level scripts "prepare_kernel.sh" and
"build_dtrace.sh" must be run from the directory where this README file is
located.  Do not run these scripts from another directory.

These scripts also assume the Ubuntu installation is on an x86_64/amd64 system.

First, run ./prepare_kernel.sh to build a DTrace enabled kernel. While
prepare_kernel.sh is running, the (git) cloned source code and activity log
files will be created in the ./kernel/ subdirectory.

Afterward (once the DTrace enabled kernel is running) the userspace application
executable can be built.  The script build_dtrace.sh builds this userspace
application.
